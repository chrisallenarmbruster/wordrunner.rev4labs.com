# WordRunner

**WordRunner** is my responsive, touch-enabled word game and vocabulary builder inspired by the aesthetics of the movie _Blade Runner 2049_. As the sole developer of this project, I've focused on creating a unique and engaging gaming experience that not only challenges players but also immerses them in a futuristic world reminiscent of the film.

## Inspiration from Blade Runner 2049

The styling of WordRunner is deeply influenced by the distinctive visual and thematic elements of _Blade Runner 2049_. Key aspects include:

- **Color Palette and Fonts**: The game adopts a color scheme and font style that are reminiscent of the movie's art direction. This includes neon highlights and dark undertones that capture the movie's iconic cyberpunk aesthetic.
- **Futuristic Elements**: Emulating the high-tech, futuristic setting of _Blade Runner 2049_, the game features digital scrambling effects and other visual elements that evoke a sense of being set in a distant, technologically advanced future.
- **Immersive Experience**: The overall design aims to transport players into the world of Blade Runner, blending the thrill of word puzzles with the captivating atmosphere of the movie.

## How to Play

### Mission Briefing

Your mission in WordRunner is to decrypt codes to progress through the game. Each code is a 5-letter word. Here's how you can crack the codes:

- **Blue Hint**: A blue indication means the letter is correct and in the right position.
- **Orange Hint**: An orange indication signals that the letter is correct but in the wrong position.
- **Attempts**: You have 6 attempts to guess the word correctly before lockout.
- **Scoring**: The score starts with the raw Scrabble word value. This value is then multiplied by 10 for every unused attempt. For example, if the word 'SMART' is solved on the fourth attempt, the score would be the raw word value of 7, multiplied by 10 twice (for the two unused attempts): 7 x 10 x 10 = 700.
